### Setting up the Development Environment



We recommend following the [Getting Started with GWT Eclipse Tutorial](http://www.gwtproject.org/usingeclipse.html).

1. Install [_Eclipse IDE for Java Developers Neon 3_](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Neon/3).

2. Then follow instructions to download and install the [GWT Eclipse Plugin](http://gwt-plugins.github.io/documentation/gwt-eclipse-plugin/Download.html).
  * _Include_ "JavaScript Debugger with Source Mapping Support" (important)
  * _Exclude_ GWT 2.X.X SDK, we will source the SDK elsewhere as it gets updated frequently.

3. In Eclipse, Help > Eclipse Marketplace, install Apache IvyDE

4. Clone this Git repository in Eclipse.

5. Download GWT SDK 2.8.2 and point the GWT Plugin to it.
